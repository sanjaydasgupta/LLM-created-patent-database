Th e electronic device includes a circuit board and one or more thermal components located on or proximate to each surface of the circuit board.

Additionally, the electronic device may include one or more air movers designed to draw ambient air into the electronic device in a manner that  causes the ambient air to cool components upstream from the air movers.
